# Happy Tweets by M (client)

The purpose of this week was to rework the own version of Twitter we created week 11, this time fetching data from our own API.

This project made me go through the use of APIs in React, useEffect and useState again. In this repository, I had to adapt the frontend to the backend I created and be mindful of how they interact with each others.

## The problem

I first generated a copy of my previous repository https://github.com/MindstormingAB/project-happy-thoughts. After creating my own API, I updated the URL in the new repository in order to use it.

In addition to these minimum requirements, I added 2 new inputs for name and category and made them appear on the tweets.
I even added 2 datalists in a new filter section to filter the tweets by name and/or category. These filters get updated as and when new names and categories are added to the application.

If I had more time, I would have implemented pagination.
